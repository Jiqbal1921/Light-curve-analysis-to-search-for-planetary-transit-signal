# Light-curve-analysis-to-search-for-planetary-transit-signal
This Python script processes multiple light curve files for exoplanet transit detection. It includes functions for detrending, noise removal using Savitzky-Golay filtering, and transit search via Box Least Squares analysis. The results are visualized by plotting the observed light curves alongside the detected transit models.
